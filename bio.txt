Hello, My name is Jimmy Zebroski.
Im currently a student at Seattle Central Community College, where Im studying Software development.
I recently moved to Downtowns Seattle to persue my passion for coding. I have a background in Software development.
This was mostly gained from taking college courses at Everett Community College, and attending a Software Development
boot camp called "Epicodus."
Im still eager to learn more and eventually break into the tech market where I can bring my enthusiasm and fresh ideas to a quickly growing market.
